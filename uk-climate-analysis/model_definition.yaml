  summary: >
    To demonstrate the validation of the user defined hypotheses using Machine learning
    algorithm about climate change in the UK.
  description: >
    Created by Aamir Patel as part of the COMP530 Big Data Project at the University of
    Liverpool. Seeks to address the following hypotheses:
    • Winter will be wetter: To test if the total number of days during winter having heavy rainfall increases
    • Summer will be warmer: To test if the total number of days during summer have temperature more than 18 degree increases
    • Summer will be drier: To test if the total number of days during summer having light rainfall decreases
    • Annual Sunshine Duration will increase: To test if the total number of hours of sunshine annually will increase
    • Snowfall in Winter will decrease: To test if the total amount of snowfall during winter will decrease
