  summary: Generates a Fibonacci sequence
  description: >
    An example Model designed for use with DAFNI Sweep Steps.

    This generates a Fibonacci sequence and saves it to a json file.
    The name of the json file will be prefixed in the following way:
    {sequence length}-{f0 start number}-{f1 start number}-sequence.json
    this is to allow this Model to work in Sweep steps.
